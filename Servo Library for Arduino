Arduino Servo Library, used for controlling servo motors in drone applications. Servo motors are essential for gimbal stabilization, camera control, landing gear movement, and other precision adjustments in drones.

🔗 Source Code: [https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Servo]

Features
✅ Precise Servo Control: Adjust servo position with high accuracy
✅ Supports Multiple Servos: Control multiple servos simultaneously
✅ Angle Control (0° - 180°): Smooth and stable servo positioning
✅ PWM-based Control: Uses PWM signals to adjust servo position
✅ Lightweight & Efficient: Works on Arduino and other microcontrollers

Functions
attach(pin): Attaches a servo motor to a specific Arduino pin
write(angle): Moves the servo to the specified angle (0° - 180°)
writeMicroseconds(value): Sends a microsecond value (for fine control)
read(): Gets the current servo angle
detach(): Stops controlling the servo to free up the pin

Application in Drones
🚁 Gimbal Stabilization: Smooth camera movements for aerial photography
🚁 Camera Pan & Tilt: Adjusts camera angle for better vision
🚁 Landing Gear Control: Retractable landing systems for drones
🚁 Aerodynamic Adjustments: Servo-based control surfaces for better maneuvering

How to Use
Connect the servo signal wire to an Arduino PWM pin.
Use the Servo library functions to control the servo movement.
Adjust angles dynamically based on sensor inputs or user commands.
