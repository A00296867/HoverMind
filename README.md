# üöÅ Disaster Response & Search and Rescue Drone
üìå Project Overview
This project aims to develop an autonomous search and rescue drone that can assist in disaster relief operations. The drone will be equipped with thermal imaging, GPS, and real-time telemetry to locate survivors and deliver emergency supplies.

Initially, the drone will be controlled using a Bluetooth module (HC-05/HC-06) and a mobile app for short-range testing. If Bluetooth proves unreliable, we will transition to a radio transmitter and receiver system for better range and stability.

üîπ Features & Functionality

‚úÖ Search & Rescue Capabilities
Uses thermal imaging and GPS to locate survivors in disaster zones.
Capable of carrying and delivering emergency supplies to designated locations.

‚úÖ Control System
Phase 1: Bluetooth-based control via a custom mobile app.
Phase 2 (If Needed): Integration of an RC transmitter & receiver for extended range.
Failsafe system to ensure the drone lands safely if communication is lost.

‚úÖ Autonomous Flight & Navigation
MPU6050 IMU for stability and motion tracking.
PID-based motor control for smooth and responsive flight.
Altitude and position monitoring for precise movement.

‚úÖ Live Telemetry & Monitoring
Real-time data transmission for battery status, altitude, and position tracking.
Mobile app interface for easy monitoring and control.

üöÄ Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Bluetooth-Based Drone Control

‚úî Setup Bluetooth module (HC-05/HC-06) and integrate with Arduino.

‚úî Develop a simple mobile app for sending throttle, roll, pitch, and yaw commands.

‚úî Test motor response to mobile commands and implement failsafe auto-landing.


Phase 2: Flight Stabilization & Autonomous Navigation

‚úî Implement PID control for smooth and stable flight.

‚úî Integrate altitude monitoring and position tracking.


Phase 3: Advanced Features & Long-Range Communication

‚úî Expand control range using RC transmitter & receiver if Bluetooth is insufficient.

‚úî Add thermal imaging & GPS tracking for automated rescue missions.


phase 4: 
The drone uses facial recognition technology to identify and approach a person in need, delivering a payload to the target. The system is designed to be fully automated, with the drone controlling flight and facial recognition independently.

Features
Facial Recognition: The drone is equipped with facial recognition technology to detect and identify a specific person.
Autonomous Flight: The drone can fly upwards, search for the target face, and automatically navigate toward the identified individual.
Payload Delivery: Once the target is identified, the drone drops a payload at the person‚Äôs location.
Hardware
Drone: Chubory A68 Brushless Drone
Arduino: Used for interfacing with the drone's joystick to automate flight control
Joystick: Reverse-engineered to interface with the Arduino for flight control
Current Progress
Joystick Integration: The team is currently investigating and reverse-engineering the joystick to reconnect it with the Arduino for automated control of the drone.
Facial Recognition: The facial recognition system is being tested and integrated with the drone‚Äôs flight control.
