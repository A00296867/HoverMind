This repository contains a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Controller implementation designed for drone stabilization and flight control. PID control is essential for maintaining balance, stability, and responsiveness in drones by continuously adjusting motor speeds based on sensor feedback.

ðŸ”— Source Code: [https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library/blob/master/PID_v1.h]

Features

Precise Flight Control: Adjusts motor speeds to maintain stable flight.
Automatic & Manual Modes: Switch between auto-stabilization and manual tuning
Customizable PID Parameters: Fine-tune Kp (Proportional), Ki (Integral), and Kd (Derivative) values
Direct & Reverse Control: Supports different drone configurations
Adjustable Sampling Time: Optimize the PID loop execution for real-time drone control
Functions
Compute(): Executes PID calculations to adjust motor outputs
SetMode(int Mode): Switch between Automatic (stabilization mode) and Manual
SetOutputLimits(double min, double max): Restrict motor power output
SetTunings(double Kp, double Ki, double Kd): Adjust PID gains for optimal performance
SetControllerDirection(int direction): Define control direction for drone orientation
SetSampleTime(int time): Adjusts the PID loop execution frequency
Application in Drones

This PID controller helps in:
âœ… Stabilizing the drone mid-flight
âœ… Correcting angular deviations using gyroscope and accelerometer data
âœ… Controlling pitch, roll, and yaw for smooth maneuvering
âœ… Ensuring steady hover and responsive movements
